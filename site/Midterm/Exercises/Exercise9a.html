        <h1>League of Legends WIKI</h1>
        <h5>by Rie Zhenzy Zumel</h5>
        <p>I have been playing League of Legends for about 6 years now, and I am 
            proud to say that League of Legends is a very competitive MOBA game. 
            The only way of getting better at playing the game is by practice, and 
            that's why so many players are investing their time playing the game. 
            League of Legends is fun when playing with your friends. Sometimes you 
            will get frustrated at them and even punch them in the face because of 
            your frustration. League of Legends is a mental game, and it will suck 
            a lot of energy because 1 game will last for about 30minutes to 45 minutes. 
            League of Legends is fun because you will meet a lot of people and you can 
            be their friends. Playing League of Legends is hard at first. Still, after 
            some time, you will get used to it. Eventually, you will get addicted like 
            the other million league players around the world. League of Legends also 
            has no age boundaries, so anyone can play it as long as they know how 
            to use a mouse and keyboard. It's never too late to try playing League 
            because it gets updated every 2 weeks. But before you install League of 
            Legends to your computer, read first the story of how League of legends begun.

        <h2>What is League of Legends?</h2>
        <p>League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, 
            in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities 
            from an isometric, or top-down, perspective. Over the course of a match, 
            champions gain levels by gaining experience points (XP) through killing non-player 
            enemies called minions. Items also increase the strength of champions, 
            and are bought using gold earned by killing minions, or destroying enemy 
            structures. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased 
            through a shop menu that is only available to players when their champion 
            is in the team's base. Each match is discrete; levels and items do not
            transfer from one match to another.</p>
