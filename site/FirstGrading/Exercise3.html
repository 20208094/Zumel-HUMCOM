        This is a quick and easy recipe for pork siomai. This is the recipe that I prefer the
        most because it is simple and straightforward. It also allows everone to enjoy their favorite siomai
        in 30 minutes or less.

    <h2 style="color: brown;"><b>WHAT IS SIOMAI?</b></h2>
        <h3><font style="color: #F2EDD7;">______</font>
            Siomai is a type of Chinese dumpling. It can be made from different
            types of meat and vegetables with the addition of seasonings and spices.
            The ingredients are mixed altogheter and secured in a wrapper.

        <h3><font style="color: #F2EDD7;">______</font>
            The Siomai that we will do is a Philippine version. We will use pork, a little bit of 
            shrimp, along with egg and vegetables. The egg serves as the binder with the main function of holding
            all the ingredients together. It also prevents the mixture from crumbling. Siomai is usually cooked
            by steam, or through a method known as steaming. It is best eaten with a dip composed of soy
            sauce and calamansi and a spoonful of spicy chili garlic paste.
