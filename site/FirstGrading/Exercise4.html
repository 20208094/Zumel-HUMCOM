                <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
                    I have been playing League of Legends for about 6 years now, and I am 
                    proud to say that League of Legends is a very competitive MOBA game. 
                    The only way of getting better at playing the game is by practice, and 
                    that's why so many players are investing their time playing the game. 
                    League of Legends is fun when playing with your friends. Sometimes you 
                    will get frustrated at them and even punch them in the face because of 
                    your frustration. League of Legends is a mental game, and it will suck 
                    a lot of energy because 1 game will last for about 30minutes to 45 minutes. 
                    League of Legends is fun because you will meet a lot of people and you can 
                    be their friends. Playing League of Legends is hard at first. Still, after 
                    some time, you will get used to it. Eventually, you will get addicted like 
                    the other million league players around the world. League of Legends also 
                    has no age boundaries, so anyone can play it as long as they know how 
                    to use a mouse and keyboard. It's never too late to try playing League 
                    because it gets updated every 2 weeks. But before you install League of 
                    Legends to your computer, read first the story of how League of legends begun.

                <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
                    League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, 
                    in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities 
                    from an isometric, or top-down, perspective. Over the course of a match, 
                    champions gain levels by gaining experience points (XP) through killing non-player 
                    enemies called minions. Items also increase the strength of champions, 
                    and are bought using gold earned by killing minions, or destroying enemy 
                    structures. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased 
                    through a shop menu that is only available to players when their champion 
                    is in the team's base. Each match is discrete; levels and items do not
                    transfer from one match to another.

                    <article>
                        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
                            Riot Games's founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merill had an 
                            idea for a spiritual successor to the MOBA Defense of the Ancients, 
                            known as DotA. A mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, DotA required
                            players to buy Warcraft III and install custom software; 
                            The Washington Post's Brian Crecente said the mod "lacked a 
                            level of polish and was often hard to find and set up". Phillip 
                            Kollar of Polygon noted that Blizzard Entertainment supported Warcraft 
                            III with an expansion pack, then shifted their focus to other projects 
                            while the game still had players. Beck and Merill sought to create a game 
                            that would be supported over a significantly longer period of time.

                            League of Legends was announced October 7, 2008 for Microsoft Windows.
                            Closed beta-testing began in April 2009. Upon the launch of the beta, 
                            seventeen champions were available. Riot initially aimed to ship the 
                            game with 20 champions, but doubled the number before the game's full release 
                            in North America on October 27, 2009. Although the game's full name 
                            was announced as League of Legends: Clash of Fates, the subtitle was dropped 
                            prior to launch.

                    <h3>Post-Release</h3>
                    <article>
                        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
                            League of Legends receives regular updates in the form of patches. 
                            Although previous games had utilized patches to ensure no one strategy dominated, 
                            League of Legends's patches made keeping pace with the developer's changes a core 
                            part of the game. In 2014, Riot standardized their patch cadence to once approximately 
                            every two or three weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
                            The development team includes hundreds of game designers and artists. In 2016, 
                            the music team had four full-time composers and a team of producers creating audio 
                            for the game and its promotional materials. As of 2019, the game has over 140 champions,
                            and frequently radically overhauls the visuals and gameplay of their oldest champions.
                            Although only available for Microsoft Windows at launch, a Mac version of the game was 
                            made available in March 2013.

                    <h3>Summoner's Rift</h3>
                    <article>
                        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
                            Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends 
                            and the most prominent in professional-level play. The mode has a 
                            ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's 
                            skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. 
                            There are nine tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, 
                            and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger. Two teams of five 
                            players compete to destroy the opposing team's nexus, which is guarded by 
                            the enemy champions and defensive structures known as turrets. Each team's 
                            nexus is located in their base, beside the "fountain"—where players start the 
                            game or reappear after a death. Minions, which are not controlled by players, 
                            are generated from each team's three inhibitors. These inhibitors are structures 
                            located behind the third tower of each lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's 
                            inhibitors causes stronger allied minions to spawn in that lane. Minions 
                            advance toward the opposing team's base along three lanes guarded by turrets: 
                            top, middle, and bottom. In the "jungle"—the region between lanes—are "monsters" 
                            that, like minions, reappear at regular intervals. Like minions, monsters provide 
                            gold and XP when killed. Another, more powerful class of monster resides 
                            within the river that separates each team's jungle. These monsters require multiple 
                            players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team. For example, 
                            a team that slays Baron Nashor greatly increases the durability of their minions, 
                            making it difficult for enemy players to clear them.

                        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
                            Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent game modes. ARAM 
                            ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five mode like Summoner's Rift, but with only 
                            one long lane, no jungle area, and with champions randomly chosen for players. Given the 
                            small size of the map, players must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
                            Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler released in June 2020. As with others in its 
                            genre, players build a team and battle to be the last one standing. Players do not 
                            directly affect combat, but position their units on a board for them to fight automatically 
                            against opponents each round. Teamfight Tactics is available for mobile operating 
                            systems iOS and Android, and has cross-platform play with the Windows and macOS clients.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
                            Other game modes have been made available on a temporary basis. Ultra Rapid Fire 
                            (URF) mode was available for 2 weeks as a 2014 April Fools Day prank. In the mode, 
                            champion abilities have no resource cost, significantly reduced cooldown timers, 
                            increased movement speed, reduced healing, and faster attacks. URF was available for 
                            two weeks. A year later, in April 2015, Riot disclosed that they had not brought 
                            the mode back because its unbalanced design resulted in player "burnout", many quitting 
                            League of Legends entirely. The developer also said the costs associated of maintaining 
                            and balancing URF were too high.
                        </p>
