    <h3>    <u>The Three <font color='red'><b><i>Little</i></b></font> Pigs</u>, written by <u>James Orchard Halliwell</u> in 1849, 
        is a fable about three pigs who build three houses of different materials. 
        A <font color='red'><b><i>Big Bad</i></b></font> Wolf blows down the first two pigs' houses, made of straw and sticks respectively, 
        but is unable to destroy the third pig's house, made of bricks. Printed versions date back to the 1840s, 
        but the story itself is thought to be much 
        <font color='red'><b><i>older</i></b></font>. The phrases used in the story, and the various morals drawn from it, 
        have become embedded in Western culture. Many versions of The Three <font color='red'><b><i>Little</i></b></font>
         Pigs have been recreated and modified over the years, sometimes making the wolf a <font color='red'><b><i>kind</i></b></font>
         character.
